    Module wrapper that returns intermediate layers from a model

    It has a strong assumption that the modules have been registered
    into the model in the same order as they are used.
    This means that one should **not** reuse the same nn.Module
    twice in the forward if you want this to work.

    Additionally, it is only able to query submodules that are directly
    assigned to the model. So if `model` is passed, `model.feature1` can
    be returned, but not `model.feature1.layer2`.
